# Todo
This  is my initial code to make a Todo app. The basic purpose is to Create a database of tasks and have the feature to perform CRUD operations on the Postgres Database.

## Main components
1. To enable user to add/delete/update tasks.
2. To enable user to search existing tasks on the basis of name/priority/status/date.
3. To enable user to update the priority of existing tasks.

## Current State
1. User is able to add tasks to database.
2. User is able to know whether task exist in database.

## Work needed to be done
1. Add ability to update database.
2. Add ability to change priority of tasks.
3. Optimize search mechanism.
4. Refine the way data is displayed.

## How to run this in current state
